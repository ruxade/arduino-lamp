## Breathing Lamp

### Project Overview
This project, created as part of a university design exercise, is a chandelier designed to evoke the organic structure and motion of a rib cage during the process of breathing. Inspired by the anatomy of pork ribs and their association with the dining table, the chandelier reflects both form and function in a sculptural, kinetic design.

### Concept
The design is a response to the brief of creating a chandelier for an entrée table. Drawing inspiration from the anatomy of a rib cage, we:

Used 13 pairs of ribs to replicate the natural curvature and structure.
Connected the ribs with a central circular element, symbolizing the spine that provides support and coherence to the structure.
Aimed to mimic the natural breathing motion through a kinetic feature, adding an immersive and dynamic element to the design.

### Design Process
Inspiration and Initial Exploration

The rib cage was chosen as the central metaphor, linking the act of dining with the structure of life.
We studied the anatomical structure and how it moves during breathing, identifying key design elements to replicate this in the chandelier.
Iterations and Testing

Various materials and shapes were tested to achieve the desired organic form while ensuring stability and functionality.
The form evolved into a dynamic, sculptural object that captures the undulating motion of ribs during respiration.
Kinetic Movement

Breathing served as a key conceptual and mechanical feature of the chandelier.
The kinetic mechanism allows the chandelier to expand and contract, imitating the rhythm of human breathing.

### Materials and Construction
Ribs: Constructed from lightweight yet durable materials to simulate the curvature and structure of actual ribs.
Central Element (Spine): A circular framework that acts as the anchor and connection point for the ribs.
Kinetic Mechanism: Engineered to produce smooth, rhythmic movement that emulates the motion of breathing.

### Features
Organic Aesthetic: The design captures the beauty and symmetry of natural forms.
Kinetic Functionality: The breathing motion adds a dynamic and calming effect, making it more than just a light fixture—it becomes an experience.
Symbolism: The chandelier connects the acts of dining and breathing, emphasizing the sustenance of life.
